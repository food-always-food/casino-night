# casino-night

This represents a system used for a poker night with friends. An RFID reader will be used in conjuction with a poker chip sent to each player in advace of the event.
Upon arrival the chip can be scanned at the door to welcome the player by name and give them a seat at the table

- Run on raspberry Pi
- Connected RFID Reader
- Flask with websockets to update the page in response to a scaned tag
- If the pi is connected to the internet, then this can trigger information to be sent to the dealer, bartender, host etc based on the arrival of the guest.

Still looking for more uses of the tech for the evening.
